Hello I am Graig Kipkorir.I am passionate with the internet, web development, and software engineering. I love tech and I am anElectrical andElectronics engineering student. fun fact: Polo G is my most inspirational artist.
I think of myself as an ambivert. I have traits of both
    introversion and extroversion, and depending on the situation, my mood, and
    my objectives, I can switch between the two. I do believe that I have a good
    sense of fashion. I really do love cars. I'd consider long drives as a fun
    activity I love, I dont hate chess but I equally dont like it that much but
    I do make a great coach of chess. The one thing that I'd really love to do
    is sky diving.
