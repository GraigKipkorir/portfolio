    Hello my name is Graig Kipkorir. Most peopel call me Craig. That was
    supposed to be my name but Graig became it lol. I am passionate with the
    internet, web development, and software engineering. I love tech and I
    pursue Electrical and Electronics engineering, I lovveeeee music. wowwww I
    really do love music, Polo G is the most inspirational artist I love at the
    moment in 2022 I think of myself as an ambivert. I have traits of both
    introversion and extroversion, and depending on the situation, my mood, and
    my objectives, I can switch between the two. I do believe that I have a good
    sense of fashion. I really do love cars. I'd consider long drives as a fun
    activity I love, I dont hate chess but I equally dont like it that much but
    I do make a great coach of chess. The one thing that I'd really love to do
    is sky diving.
